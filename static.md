#static
##feature
`shared`
* as for member variable
	ex:static int a;
	a can be called by all objects(object.variable) ,class(class.variable)--->(static-only,non-static variable CAN'T be accessed by class.variable).
* we use `static` only when the data need to be `SHARED` by all object.

* when re-write the variable modified by static from `a` to `b`,then the variable becomes to `b`
